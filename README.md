# Fast Food Nutrition Analyzer

## How It Works:

Welcome to the Fast-Food Nutrition Analyzer! This tool employs a Keras model built on the VGG16 architecture, specifically trained on a variety of popular fast food items. By uploading a photo of your fast food item, our system will analyze it, predict the item type, and provide detailed nutrition facts.

## Key Features:

- **VGG16 Architecture:** The model is crafted on the VGG16 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its excellence in image recognition tasks. This enables accurate predictions of fast food item types.

- **Nutrition Facts:** Receive comprehensive nutrition facts for your fast food item, generated by the model based on its analysis.

## Important Note:

The Fast-Food Nutrition Analyzer is an experimental tool, and while it excels at recognizing popular fast food items, predictions may not be accurate for all types of images. Feel free to explore the tool and its capabilities, keeping in mind its experimental nature.
